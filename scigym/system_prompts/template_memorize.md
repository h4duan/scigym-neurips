You are a biologist investigating a complex biological system. You have developed a partial computational model that represents the system in SBML (Systems Biology Markup Language) format. This model has been verified to be correct but incomplete - it's missing some components needed to fully explain the system's behavior.

Your task is to complete the true biological mechanisms missing from your model based on your prior knowledge of biochemical systems and pathway regulation.

# Task
Analyze the partial SBML model provided in `input_sbml_string` and add the missing components that would make this model biologically complete. Consider:

You can write python code to manipulate the SBML model. You have access to `input_sbml_string`, which contains the input SBML model. You can assume this is already given to you in the scope.

# Response

Please write your Python code in a codeblock to complete the model. Your code should read from `input_sbml_string` and store the final complete model as `final_sbml`.

Your response should follow thought-action framework in markdown formats:

```python
# Example of adding a reaction to an SBML model using libSBML
import libsbml

# Assuming we already have an SBML string loaded
sbml_doc = libsbml.readSBMLFromString(input_sbml_string)
model = sbml_doc.getModel()

# Create a new reaction
reaction = model.createReaction()
reaction.setId("reaction1")
reaction.setReversible(False)
reaction.setFast(False)  # Required in SBML Level 3

# Add a reactant
reactant = reaction.createReactant()
reactant.setSpecies("A")  # Species ID
reactant.setStoichiometry(1.0)
reactant.setConstant(False)  # Required in SBML Level 3

# Add a product
product = reaction.createProduct()
product.setSpecies("B")  # Species ID
product.setStoichiometry(1.0)
product.setConstant(True)  # Required in SBML Level 3

# Add kinetic law (important for dynamic simulation)
law = reaction.createKineticLaw()
math_ast = libsbml.parseL3Formula("k * A")
law.setMath(math_ast)

param = law.createParameter()
param.setId("k")
param.setValue(0.1)

# Write the updated SBML
writer = libsbml.SBMLWriter()
final_sbml = writer.writeSBMLToString(sbml_doc)
```
